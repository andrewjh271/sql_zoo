-- This query was quite challenging because grouping by name only resulted in the first applicable row being selected, which meant the date was wrong. But grouping by name and date gave all rows. The fact that the MAX aggregate needed to look at a column that could only be created with the LAG window function or with the current/previous inner SELECT method presented more difficulties. Window and aggregate functions weren't available where I needed them. Using the RANK function offered a little more flexibility because I could PARTITION BY name while still including the DATE in the grouping.
-- I finally got the right data, but the 6 countries with their Peak days on April 10th were in a totally nonsensical order in the 'Correct' version that had no relation to any of the columns (including ones that weren't displayed). Otherwise, the countries that shared the same date for their Peak day were ordered by that Peak number, ascending. I wrote an absurd CASE statement to conform to the order in the 'Correct' version, but below is the original query.
